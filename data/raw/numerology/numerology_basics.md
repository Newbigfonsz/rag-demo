# Numerology Basics and Core Numbers

## What is Numerology?

Numerology is the study of the mystical relationship between numbers and life events. It suggests that numbers carry vibrations that influence personality, destiny, and life cycles. Modern numerology is based on the Pythagorean system, which assigns numbers 1-9 to letters of the alphabet.

## The Five Core Numbers

A complete numerology profile includes five core numbers calculated from your name and birth date.

### 1. Life Path Number (Most Important)
**What it reveals**: Your life purpose and the path you're meant to walk
**How to calculate**: Add all digits of your birth date until you get a single digit (or master number 11, 22, 33)

Example: December 15, 1985
- Month: 1 + 2 = 3
- Day: 1 + 5 = 6
- Year: 1 + 9 + 8 + 5 = 23 → 2 + 3 = 5
- Total: 3 + 6 + 5 = 14 → 1 + 4 = **5**

Important: If you get 11, 22, or 33 before the final reduction, keep it as a master number.

### 2. Expression Number (Destiny Number)
**What it reveals**: Your natural abilities and how you express yourself
**How to calculate**: Convert your full birth name to numbers, then add
